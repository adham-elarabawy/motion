    "## Source\n",
    "All referenced implementations can be found in [my motion repository](https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/motion). \n",
    "\n",
    "All jerk-limited implementations are based on [this textbook](http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~ptrojane/books/Trajectory_Planning_for_Automatic_Machines_and_Robots.pdf).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, all simple motion planning that occurs on the Fuse machines is orchestrated by a trapezoidal/triangular motion planner, which effectively describes the resulting velocity profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *From here on out, I will be referring to triangular and trapezoidal velocity profiles as trapezoidal for concision. The main difference is that a triangular profile is used when the maximum velocity is not reached based on the given parameters, so the trajectory must decelerate before hitting a velocity plateau.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This trapezoidal velocity profile is generated via setting maximum acceleration/deceleration during certain periods, and then integrating the resultant acceleration to generate the corresponding velocity/position profiles. These profiles can then be discretized and sampled to generate low-level stepper motor move commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a trapezoidal velocity profile:\n",

    "The above trajectory was generated by [this code](https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/motion/blob/main/examples/run_trapezoidal.py).\n",
